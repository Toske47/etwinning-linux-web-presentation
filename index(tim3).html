	<h3>Icaros</h3>
	<p>Nostalgic open source fans can still get their dose of Amiga-esque goodness through Icaros.
		This is a distribution of Aros, which is an OS based on the AmigaOS API.
		It’s tricky to install, and it’d be a frustrating experience to even attempt to explore the OS without first reading its user guide.<br>
		First-time users should appreciate the fact that the OS is distributed as an installable live CD to whet their appetite.<br>
		Click on the eye icon in the panel to get an Applications menu, or on the filing cabinet to get a selection of manuals.</p>
	<p>Icaros has pretty decent hardware support, but still don’t expect it to work with fancy graphics cards and all wireless network hardware.<br>
		Icaros has all the apps you need to use it as a regular desktop, but its real specialty is retro gaming, and that’s one area in which it really shines.<br></p>

	<h3>ArcaOS</h3>
	<p>
		Do you have a custom written OS/2 application? Favorite, classic OS/2 productivity, word processing, spreadsheet, or graphics applications? OS/2, Windows 3.1, or DOS games?
		ArcaOS runs all of those just like OS/2 Warp 4, only better.ArcaOS is more compatible with modern hardware, makes more efficient use of memory and system resources,
		and installs more easily than any other OS/2 distribution…ever.Really.</p>
	<p>
		Do you have a system with 16GB of RAM in it? Want your apps to really fly? Configure ArcaOS to utilize all memory above 4GB as a RAM disk, and at bootup, copy your most frequently used applications there. It’s like running your OS/2, Windows,
		DOS, REXX, Java, and ported Linux applications on air.</p><br>

	<h3>FreeDOS</h3>
	<p>
		FreeDOS is an open source developed DOS-based operating system under the GNU General Public License , born to keep free DOS alive after Microsoft stopped developing MS-DOS in 1999.<br>
		Its aim is to be 100% compatible with DOS and this goal has been almost completely achieved.<br>
		With this operating system, it is possible to connect to the Internet with very old computers using the open source Arachne web browser.<br>
		Computers that are sold without any operating system installed in the market are also offered as FreeDos.<br>
		Some users prefer desktop computers and laptops with FreeDos installed at a cheaper price due to the fact that FreeDos is free.</p>
	<p>Features:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			It's free.
		</li>
		<li>
			It is 100% open source. (Distributed under the GNU License).
		</li>
		<li>
			It is based on DOS.
		</li>
		<li>
			It can run under DOSBOX or DOSEMU ( dos emulator under GNU / Linux ).
		</li>
		<li>
			It can run old DOS applications without any problems.
		</li>
		<li>
			It has long filenames and FAT32 support.
		</li>
		<li>
			It has USB support.
		</li>
		<li>
			It has a 32-bit version.

	<h3>KolibriOS</h3>

	<p>
		KolibriOS is written in the FASM assembly language and based on the source code of the MenuetOS operating system.<br>
		It boots in a flash and gives you access to a number of useful apps.<br>
		There’s no installation involved, though you’ll have to make sure you select the option to save the changes you made during the session when you shut it down.</p>
	<p>
		The only shortcoming of the OS is that its productivity apps aren’t really mature enough for everyday use, and the lack of a package manager doesn’t help its case either.
		On the other hand, if you like retro gaming there’s no better OS.</p>

	<h3>Visopsys</h3>

	<p>
		The goal of the OS is to create a fully functional OS for Computer Science students and alternate OS enthusiasts like us.<br>
		Considering the fact that it’s primarily an educational system, Visopsys surprised us with its usability.<br>
		The OS boots in a snap and gives you the option to either launch the installer or boot into a Live session.<br>
		The inclusion of a very capable partitioner in the installer is another pleasant surprise</p>
	<p>
		The desktop is fairly simple to navigate and includes a handful of essential apps, plus handy administration and configuration utilities.<br>
		But attempts to use it for regular desktop tasks won’t take you very far, as the OS is missing a web browser and there’s no package management to help you pull in additional apps and utilities.<br>
		Visopsys does a nice job of masquerading as a regular desktop, but it really is a very capable CS project and should be treated as such.</p>

	<h3>Syllable Desktop</h3>

	<p>
		Developed between 1994 and 2001, AtheOS – initially planned as a clone of AmigaOS but later following its own path – was the work of a lone Norwegian programmer, Kurt Skauen.
		After Skauen abandoned the project, its GPL-licensed source code was picked up by the community and Syllable Desktop was born.<br>
		The majority of it is composed of unique code, although certain components have been pulled from the vast library of open source Linux programs; there's also a Server version, which is more traditionally Linux.</p>

	<p>
		Syllable's key selling point – ignoring the fact that it's free – is its speed and lightness. The creators recommend a Pentium CPU with 32MB of RAM, which should give you an idea of how lightweight it is.
		Slap this on a modern PC and you'll likely never have seen an OS so quick.
		Syllable does lack the ports that make other indie operating systems attractive, though it contains a number of native apps for web browsing, email, VNC and more. We're not entirely positive that it's still active – the last official update was
		some time in 2012 – but if there's a very, very old PC you need to resurrect with reasonably modern system architecture, try this.</p>

	<h3>SkyOS</h3>

	<p>
		The development of SkyOS has sadly been halted, but it's still worth looking at as an example of an OS constructed from scratch.<br>
		Developed initially as an open source project by coder Robert Szeleney, SkyOS was based on concepts gleaned from other platforms but didn't originally borrow their code.<br>
		That said, a few components are based on other packages – there's no sense, for example, developing an entirely new compiler when GCC already exists, and the SkyFS filesystem is forked from OpenBFS.
		Later in its life, Szeleney appears to have experimented with a version of SkyOS built on top of a Linux kernel in an attempt to help with driver compatibility.</p>

	<p>
		The source was closed midway through its life, and Szeleney continued development based on feedback from a popular (paid) public beta program. Unfortunately the struggle to keep up with ever-diversifying computing standards became too much for
		the lone coder, and development was halted in 2009, with the most recent beta made publicly available in 2013.
		It's obviously incomplete, and not suitable for any kind of business environment, but as a curio to run within a VM it's very interesting.</p>

	<h3>TempleOS</h3>

	<p>
		Whether the extreme religious doctrine behind it interests you or not, TempleOS is an interesting example of a completely independent, unique OS.
		It's been made and maintained with extreme dedication by one man, Terry A. Davis, over the course of ten years.</p>

	<p>
		TempleOS – programmed entirely using Davis' own language, the excellently named HolyC, which you also use to interact with its shell – deliberately includes no networking and absolutely no hardware support beyond that which forms the core PC
		system.<br>
		So what's the point?<br>
		TempleOS has been built from the ground up with what seems like no hang-ups on existing operating systems. The entire thing is hyperlinked, meaning you can quickly burrow down to the source of a program just as easily as you can find its
		dependencies, and it's super-quick; there's no paging, so the whole OS gets up and running within a second or two.</p>
